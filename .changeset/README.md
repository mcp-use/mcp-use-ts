# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Quick Start

### Creating a Changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changes
2. Choose the version bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

### Applying Changesets (Versioning)

```bash
pnpm version
```

This will:
- Apply all pending changesets
- Update package versions
- Generate/update CHANGELOG.md files
- Update dependencies

### Publishing to npm

```bash
pnpm release
```

This will:
- Build all packages
- Publish updated packages to npm
- Create git tags
